    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This delicious stuffed eggplant with a cheesy top is a must-try recipe!
      Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini eggplants and use them for
      a side dish or appetizer.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (1Â½ pound) eggplant, halved lengthwise</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1 cup tomato-basil pasta sauce</li>
      <li>3/4 cup Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut around the edge of the flesh in each eggplant half using a sharp
        paring knife, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Scoop out flesh using a spoon,
        leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; reserve flesh and chop into bite-size
        pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush shells with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and
        pepper; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over
        medium high heat. Add sausage, onion, mushrooms, and garlic; cook and
        stir until sausage is evenly brown. Stir in reserved chopped eggplant
        and basil. Add pasta sauce; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup
        of panko and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stuff mixture into eggplant shells. Combine remaining panko and cheese
        in a small bowl; sprinkle over stuffing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
